*Before we get into to setState(), we first need to get a basic understanding of what state, components, react, and javascript are..*

From the beginning we have **JavaScript**, a scripting language that is responsible for the creation of dynamic websites by updating content based on user events (such as clicks, scrolling, refreshing, even inputing information to login, and more!). JavaScript is can also be behind animations, music and videos, and more things you see on a website. More information on JavaScript can be found [here!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

Next, there is **React.js**, a popular library used with JavaScript, created by Facebook. Simply put, React.js is a JavaScript file with pre-written functions that allow for easier development of the front-end of a dynamic website, in other words the User-Interface(UI), thus allowing an efficient way to build interactive websites quickly. Components, State, and setState all belong to the React.js library, let's take a brief look at each below before diving into setState()

**Components:**

**State:**

**setState():**
