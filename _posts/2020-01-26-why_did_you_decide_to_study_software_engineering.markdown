The number one reason I decided to get into software engineering was to get into a better career.

As a sales professional, you are dependent upon commission checks as your main source of income, not your actual salary. At first that seemed great to me as a young, determined college grad who was searching for a position to get out what was put in. I thought sales was the best thing for me, and it was for a short amount of time. Hitting commission was an amazing feeling, knowing that I was in control of how much money I made was great. But it was shortlived, there is no future in sales, it's all about now now now. What have you done for me lately?

Ultimately, I reached my tipping point and decided it's time for a change, for me to develop some skills that will be essential in the future. After plenty of research, I found software engineering would be the best return on my investment and the key to a rewarding career path. Once I began going through the bootcamp preparation course, I found myself struggling, but enjoying the process of solving the problem. That was when I knew this would be right for me to pursue and I couldn't be more excited to begin this journey.
