## More to come upon my review... but until then..

### Don't let the program file structure scare ya!

There are many different folders/files you'll be creating, and with the help of corneal you'll get a nice start, but the majority of your code will likely lie within the controller files. Whereas your views showcase whats happening in the browser and will contain quite a bit of html and css. That's right, html and css, paired with ruby, a bit of sqlite3, and what else!? This is where I felt like a software engineer, powering up shotgun and refreshing my page as I edit code to see my work in action was amazing.

MVC
CRUD
Sessions/Signup/Login
