A new beginning is in sight, the final module of the SE bootcamp is nearing an end.
This project will showcase all that I've learned during the bootcamp in an amazing web application utilizing a rails api backend to CRUD our data and a react/redux front end to actually see the content of my application along with the data and the ability to CRUD. I also introduced the canvas tag because I love the visual effects.

This application is a basic replica of those account applications we all use if we utilize online banking services through banks such as Chase. More to come on the project itself and some cool code used to make it awesome after the review...
