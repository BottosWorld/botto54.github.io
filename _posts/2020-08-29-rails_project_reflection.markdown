## *More to come after the project review*

CLI check, Sinatra check, Rails was a lot like sinatra but with less work thanks to our rails generators (model, controller, and resource - my fav) and some new ideas.

Wrapping my head around the has many through concept with my own project idea is where I struggled during this one.

I wanted to focus on something different than what we did during the lessons, no blog posts with comments by other users.. but what else follows that same model? Another example throughout the lessons were houses listed by a user with rooms attached to the house...

After brainstorming, I narrowed down my project idea to a finance related app vs. a real estate app..
